# Maximum-likelihood-garch-VaR-ES-backtesting
GARCH model for modeling the volatility of financial returns. The model is calibrated by optimizing the log-likelihood of the GARCH model parameters. Subsequently, a backtest is carried out to calculate the Value at Risk (VaR) and the Expected Shortfall (ES) for financial returns based on the estimated GARCH model.


# GARCH Model and Backtesting

This repository contains Python code for estimating parameters of a Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model and for backtesting the model.

## Overview

The GARCH model is a popular model in financial econometrics used to estimate volatility of returns. The backtesting process tests the performance of the GARCH model on historical data.

## Structure

- `garch.py`: Contains the implementation of the GARCH model
- `backtest.py`: Contains the implementation of the backtesting process
- `main.py`: Uses the GARCH model and backtesting process on sample data

## Usage

pip install numpy scipy
Run the main Python file:
bash
Copy code
python main.py

This will output the Value-at-Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) for the sample returns at a 95% confidence level.
